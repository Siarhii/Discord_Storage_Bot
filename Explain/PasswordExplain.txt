so the file is excrypted with a password (from user) and a init vector (which is randomly generated)
the initvect is saved in encrypted file in the first 16 bytes,
The overall flow is like :-
    1.the password is hashed (without any salt) with sha_256,then a random initvect is generated
    2.the file is compressed using gzip
    3.the 64 characters long (32 bytes) hashed paassword is then used along with the IV to encrypt the file
    4.The IV is then prepended onto that excrypted file (16bytes)
    5.HashedPassword is the resolved at the end (which will later be stored in our DB from index.js)
